Marseille, November 2019
An abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of the city. 11:47 p.m. Rain hammers the corrugated roof. Inside, a young police officer named Rémy stands over a man in a black coat. The man lies face down on concrete. Hands cuffed behind his back. On his face, a plague doctor mask. White ceramic. Long curved beak. Empty eye sockets staring at nothing.
Rémy's hands tremble. His radio crackles with static. He should wait for backup. He should follow protocol. But curiosity wins.
He kneels down. Grips the edge of the mask. Pulls it away.
The face underneath stops his breath. His eyes go wide. His mouth opens but no sound comes out. Recognition. Confusion. Terror.
A gunshot echoes through the warehouse.
